## Features

- Three subscription plans: Basic, Standard, and Premium.
- Plan details including plan name, pricing, feature list, and a "Sign Up" button.
- Billing frequency toggle for switching between monthly and yearly billing.
- Modern and visually appealing design with a distinct color scheme.
- Hover effects on plan buttons.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser to view the project.

## Usage

Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the pricing comparison table. You can interact with the toggle to switch between monthly and yearly billing.

## Styling with SASS

The project uses SASS for styling and organization of the CSS code. You can find the SASS source file in `style.scss`. Variables, mixins, and nesting are utilized effectively to improve code maintainability.

To compile the SASS code to CSS, you can use a SASS compiler or run the following command if you have SASS installed globally:

```bash
sass index.scss index.css
```

## Responsiveness

The pricing table is responsive and adapts to various screen sizes:
- On mobile, the table stacks plan information vertically for easy readability.
- On tablet, the table displays side by side for plans, and features remain readable.
- On desktop, the table has a comfortable width, and all information is presented neatly.
